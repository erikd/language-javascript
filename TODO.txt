2. Separate out the different versions of JavaScript.

Necessary?  Depends what this tool is used for.  Current assumption is
that it is fed well-formed JS, and generates an AST for further
manipulation.

3. Simplify the AST. *JSElement at the very least is redundant.

4. Clarify the external interfaces required.

5. Process comments. Some kinds of hooks exist, but they are essentially discarded.

8. String literals for ed 5 - continuation chars etc.

10. Sort out [no line terminator here] in PostfixExpression

11. Export AST as JSON or XML

  @paul_houle better tools come from the languages making their ast available,
  as json or xml: gcc --astxml a.c

12. Look at using the AST in WebBits
